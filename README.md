# CS353 Database Design Project
Bilkent University CS-353 Database Systems Course Term Project

Our project is a system for tracking medical related information for patients, doctors, and pharmacists. This tracking system allows a doctor or a patient or a pharmacist to log and monitor the medical related information and request various medical activities. This system is part of an overall information system and it interacts with the person's electronic health record, where information specific to the person is stored.
